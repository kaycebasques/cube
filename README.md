# cube

Experimental repo. I am learning how to create Bazel-based Pigweed projects.
I recently struggled to use the bare metal STM32F429I target in combination
with the STM32Cube HAL library. This repo demonstrates what I tried and where
I struggled.

This repo will probably get archived or deleted in Q2 2024.
